      Hi! I'm a full stack developer and I build things that make a difference.

      Oh. Hi there!
    p.
      I'm James, and I'm a full stack developer. These days I'm writing web apps with frameworks like AngularJS and NodeJS, but I've worked extensively with monsters like PHP and .NET - sometimes out of choice. My specialism has been in game engine development for platforms from the Nintendo DS to the web browser (I'm a bit of an optimisation junkie, but I think it's okay to admit it here).

      |  and 
      a(href="http://www.nextworldweb.co.uk/") Next World Web
      |  but in 2015 I'll be the beholder of a Computer Science degree from Lancaster University, and I'm looking for a great job in London.
