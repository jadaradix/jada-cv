h3 Introduction
p.
  If you want to learn about hacking, then exploiting DS games though their save files can be a great way to learn the basics.
p
  | DS games operate with very little security in place, if you have some code loaded in memory then you can sometimes just jump straight to it, as opposed to in more modern systems such as the 3DS where there is the 
  a(href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NX_bit") NX bit
  |  (some parts of memory can be marked as unexecutable) and in the PS Vita where there is also 
  a(href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_space_layout_randomization") ASLR
  |  (the base of the stack, and some functions are randomly arranged).
h3#who-is-this-aimed-at Who is this aimed at?
p
  | You should have a competent understanding of fairly low level programming. If you don't know what a register is, or the difference between the stack and the heap, then you probably won't get much out of this tutorial.
h3#tools-used Tools used
p
  | You will need an ARM compiler; I will be using devkitARM from 
  a(href="http://devkitpro.org/") devkitPro
  | .
p
  | You will need a DS emulator; I recommend using 
  a(href="http://desmume.org/") DeSmuME
  |  however I have heard that 
  a(href="http://problemkaputt.de/gba.htm") NO$GBA
  |  also has excellent debugging tools.
p
  | You will need a hex editor to edit save files; I will be using 
  a(href="http://www.hhdsoftware.com/free-hex-editor") Hex Editor Neo
  | .
p
  | I will also be using 
  a(href="www.cjmweb.net/vbindiff/") VBinDiff
  |  which isn't necessary but helps to identify the location of checksums within a save file.
